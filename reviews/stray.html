    <h1>Stray Game Review</h1>
    <h6>July 24, 2022</h6>

    <p>
I think I've never written a game review before, so please bear with me. I will go over various parts of the game and evaluate below.
    </p>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">The review outlines features and some narrative tidbits of the game. There are no unmarked major spoilers, but there are still some, so reader beware.</div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
Stray is a game where you play as a cat exploring a cyberpunk world. You fall into it from "the outside" and find a drone friend whose purpose in life is to get to the outside. It's a partly-open-world exploration adventure game with some stealth and combat.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Design</h2>


I'll examine the following mechanics:
<ul>
  <li>Movement</li>
  <li>Exploration</li>
  <li>Being a cat</li>
  <li>Memories</li>
  <li>Combat</li>
  <li>Stealth</li>
</ul>

<h3>Movement</h3>

<p>
The most fun part about movement was exploration, and noticing which colliders have been adjusted so that the cat could interact with them, e.g. being able to sit underneath rails, jumping on air conditioners, etc. There were definitely some parts of the game where I was frustrated by the movement controls:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>some places that I should be able to jump to but it was difficult to get into the right position to jump from</li>
  <li>fluidity of movement was not great, there were moments where I felt like the game could/should have let me keep running but I had to stop to press a button to jump</li>
  <li>on occasion the camera would take weird angles making it hard to see either the dialogue that's happening or where the cat is. This was fairly rare.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the most part, I was able to move in the way I wanted to move throughout most of the game.</p>

<h3>Exploration</h3>

<p>
Exploration was the best part of the game. Discovering nooks and crannies was very satisfying, whether you found a memory or not you might find a new napping spot, an NPC to chat with, or progress a side quest. The game rewarded you for exploring. However, there were some frustrating moments where I felt like I should be able to jump somewhere or crawl under something but couldn't. The saturation of hidden content was also inconsistent throughout the game.

    <p>
    The first big area of the game, The Slums, rewarded exploration the most as there were many places to jump to and discover. I was disappointed that the same level of care was not given to Midtown or Antvillage, and it made me wonder about scope cuts due to budget and timeline restrictions.

<h3>Being a cat</h3>

<p>
I found it was fun to discover the various behaviours of the cat, so I've marked the whole section here as a spoiler. There aren't any story spoilers in this section.
</p>

</p>
<div class="collapse" id="catBehaviourSpoiler">
  <div class="card card-body">
    <p>The game featured many cat behaviour mechanics, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jumping around</li>
      <li>Knocking stuff over</li>
      <li>Playing with balls</li>
      <li>Scratching various surfaces</li>
      <li>Drinking from random puddles of water</li>
      <li>Snoozing, and stretching when you wake</li>
      <li>Rubbing up against people</li>
      <li>Random grooms here and there</li>
      <li>Meowing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    In terms of completeness, this game featured quite a wide variety of things you could do as a cat. However, the entire time I was wondering if I would ever be able to stalk and hunt prey as a cat. This never came up. Perhaps the game would have leaned too much towards survival if there was hunting, but I was still disappointed by this.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    Jumping around as a cat was the primary mechanic of the game, and it was the one with the most rewards and gameplay integration. The other features did not receive as much care, though they were still present. For example, you could knock lots of stuff over, which was often just fun to do. Paint left splatters on the ground. Cups and bottles would crash on the floor if toppled from high enough. You could leave temporary scratch marks on certain rugs, couches and walls. Playing with the random basketballs around the place was fun, too.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There were other places where I felt the gameplay was a bit lacking. Although you could knock stuff over, jump around the place and scratch things, no one reacted to this or was annoyed by it at all. Scratching and playing for the most part had no gameplay significance. I also could not jump into a box or into many things at all until the last third of the game. You can only rub against some characters, but not all. Grooming only happened once in a while after sustaining injuries, you could not stop to groom yourself - the poor stray looked dirty the entire game. Given that cats groom so often, it was very surprising that you could not groom at all in this game, and I wonder if I completely missed the feature somehow.

<h3>Memories</h3>

<p>
I enjoyed the memories mechanic. I found it was a good way to provide some exposition about the world and the stray's constant companion, B-12. They also provided rewards at the end of an exploration and replay value. I doubt I will replay Stray because I almost never replay any games these days, but it's a nice touch for completionists. In the end I got 74% of all the memories, but notably I only spent extra time exploring in the first third of the game.

<h3>Combat</h3>

<p>
Combat was a very short section of the game, and I was glad for that. While it was satisfying at the beginning, it got repetitive fairly quickly. It had nothing to do with being a cat, but I suppose it added some variety.

<h3>Stealth</h3>
<p>
There was some stealth in the game. This felt more cat-like than the combat and it was a better fit for the gameplay. It mainly involved avoiding line of sight of certain NPCs. Some of the ways you had to do this was clever.

<h3>Narrative</h3>

<p>
The story and how it unfolded through gameplay was fairly simple. That said, it was a touching tale.

      I particularly liked the characters and storyline of the Slums, who were all just nice people and never betrayed you. This is of course a contrast to the folks in Midtown, one of whom did betray you.
    </p>

<p>
The world building and how they revealed it through chats with characters, memories and posters to translate on the wall was well done. I wanted to know more about what had happened since all the humans had died before the game started. The story also made me wonder about what kind of apocalypse we're going to be facing in real life, particularly the Zurk creatures that eat everything.

<h3>Graphics</h3>

<p>
The graphics were definitely the highlight of the game. The environments were beautifully arranged, coloured and lit, reminding me of Tokyo at night. As part of the exploration mechanic, finding hidden corners of the world and new vantage points with great views were extra rewarding because of this. The robot character design was cool. I'm fairly certain the same model was reskinned to create all the characters, but it did not feel repetitive.

</p>
<p>
The only thing I did not like about the graphics was the cat design itself. I have a cat at home who I stare at frequently and found that the stray's face fell a little into the uncanny valley. I wonder if a more stylized rather than realistic approach for the cat would have worked better, but perhaps the creators wanted to emphasize that the stray was the only fluffy creature around. That said, the animations of the cat were generally good.

<h3>Sound</h3>


<p>
I wasn't wowed by the SFX. I didn't really like the cat meows or sound effects. Overall I find my own cat, Bob, makes much cuter sounds. I don't know if the sounds were recorded from a real cat or not. It would have probably been difficult to get a cat to make various sounds on demand, maybe you would just have to be recording all the time. However I did appreciate the patter of cat feet running around.

</p>
<p>
The music was fine. None of the soundtrack really stood out to me.

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
I liked the game. Outside of the environment design, it was not particularly innovative or outstanding. The first half of the game felt like it received significantly more care than the latter half, and the ending felt a little rushed. That said, it was a simple, touching story with a great world both in terms of environment and narrative world building.

</p>

<p>
I would recommend if:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>you like colourful, beautiful (cyberpunk) environments to explore</li>
  <li>you like world building</li>
  <li>you like cats</li>
</ul>
